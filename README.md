# Gibbs-Sampling

Presentation and implementation of one of the most useful MCMC algorithms, we covered:

    - Theoretical roots of algorithm
    - 2 examples of algorithm itself with 2 different multivariate distributions, histograms for each of parameters 
        and plot for each one
    - Most common uses and
    - Failure modes
